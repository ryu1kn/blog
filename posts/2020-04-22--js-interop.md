# Using JavaScript eco-system from Clojure/Scala/Kotlin/PureScript/TypeScript

I've been playing with Clojure for close to two months now.

One thing I like about Clojure is that it seems like I'm typing fewer characters to get what I want.
Less code to read and maintain. Once I rewrote one of my recent js script with Clojure and its size
shrunk down to 2/3.

Another nice thing is that it can leverage the large collection of software asset (i.e. libraries)
that people have written for Java (JVM).

But I noticed that I was reading more characters when checking API docs or library code
for checking the use of a library. Wondered if I can save some time if use Clojure with
JavaScript libraries. I also wondered how the experience would differ if I use other languages
to do the same thing; so after I did it with Clojure, I did it with Scala, then PureScript
(which works only with js), ...

I've put them in one repository so that you can compare them yourselves, and see what can be
involved if you choose one to run your code on JavaScript engines. There is a straight JavaScript
version as well.
